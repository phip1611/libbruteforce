description = '''
This library helps you to brute force hashes (e.g. passwords). It includes a set of pre-configured
hashing functions, like md5 or sha256. You can also provide your own hashing function. PLEASE DO NOT
use this software to harm someones privacy in any kind! This project was made for fun and for teaching myself
new things about Rust.
